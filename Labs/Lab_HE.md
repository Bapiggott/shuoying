# Privacy Preservation with Homomorphic Encryption (HE) Lab

## Overview

<img src="../img/he-lab.png" align="right" width="200" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

This lab will help students build a better understanding of the purpose of HE and the confidentiality
issues in a supply chain. In particular, students will learn 1) the basic HE operations; 2) the
applications of using HE cryptographic operations in command-line and program level; 3) the
real-world problem solving with HE. The learning objectives of this lab are listed below:
1. Be able to use HE cryptographic operations in command-line and program level.
2. Be able to solve real-world problems with HE.
