# Fine-grained Access Control with Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) Lab

## Overview

<img src="../img/access-control-lab.jpg" align="right" width="200" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

This lab will help students better understand Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and cryptographic technologies of Attribute-based Encryption (ABE). Students will be introduced to two different ABE: Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE) and Key-Policy ABE (KP-ABE) and their applications. The learning objectives of this lab are listed below:
1. Be able to describe attribute-based encryption, including CP-ABE and KP-ABE.
2. Be able to compose the security policies according to various realistic scenarios.
3. Be able to integrate security policies into crypto-keys.
4. Be able to decrypt ciphertext using correct crypto-keys.
