# ReScuE (Range for Security Education)

ReScuE is a cloud-based networked virtual environment dedicated to cybersecurity education. It leverages [CloudLab](https://www.cloudlab.us/), a state-of-the-art software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) infrastructure, and deploys cybersecurity-related virtual machines and containers. On top of ReScuE, we have developed a series of hands-on labs covering a broad spectrum of cybersecurity topics in pervasive computing.

## Highlights of ReScuE

- **Adaptive to large-scale and complicated network settings.**
- **Allows exploits to be constrained.**
- **Gives instructors a privilege to use the physical machines.**
- **100% free and has zero cost for maintenance.**
- **Adoptive to various educational purposes.**

## What Does ReScuE Provide?

### Hands-on Labs
We have developed cybersecurity hands-on labs in the area of pervasive computing. They cover a wide range of cloud-based cryptography, SDN and NFV, mobile security, and forensic technologies. More labs are under finalization.

1. [Fine-grained Access Control with Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) Lab](Labs/Lab_Attribute_based_Encryption.md)
2. [Developing Mobile Malware (DMM) Lab](Labs/Lab_Developing_Mobile_Malware.md)
3. [Privacy Preservation with Homomorphic Encryption (HE) Lab](Labs/Lab_HE.md)
4. [Behavior-based Mobile Malware Analysis and Detection (MA) Lab](Labs/Lab_HE.md)


### ReScuE Cloud Environments

Built upon [CloudLab](https://www.cloudlab.us/), ReScuE provides a user-friendly interface and critical components allowing educators to set up and maintain the virtual environment. Meanwhile, ReScuE provides the web interface to monitor students' activities and resource usage for virtual artifacts.

### VMs and Containers

<img src="/img/vm-container.png" align="left" width="200" style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
ReScuE labs rely on our customized virtual machines (VMs) and containers. As educators and students, you can download them from the repository. They are free. For more information on how to build them from scratch, please get in touch with us.

### YouTube Channel
We developed YouTube channels for educators and students to get familiar with the ReScuE platform. In addition, for each hands-on lab, we provide videos, which articulate learning objectives and provide demonstration.
