# KP-ABE Exercises
## KP-ABE Problem Solving

Let’s take an exercise from the scenes of ”The Avengers” to practice KP-ABE. The Avengers is an organization founded by Nick Fury, the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D, on May 4, 2012. All team members are gifted superheroes committed to protecting the world from a variety of threats. Superheroes are assigned with different missions and often communicate with encrypted messages that can only be decrypted by certain receivers who are temporarily out of the organization HQ, which means their secret key can only decrypt messages to themselves sent on the dates when they are not in the Avengers Tower and prevents the secret message from being stolen by Hydra. Iron Man is the first member who joined the Avengers when it was founded. However, he disagreed with Captain America on the Sokovia Accords and determinedly left the Avengers on April 6, 2016. After a month, He discovered the misunderstood truth and accepted an apology from Captain America, so he returned to the group. Now, Iron Man accidentally finds four encrypted notes in Avengers Tower; their metadata is listed below:
1. The first message was sent from Thor to Hulk, dated May 10, 2012
2. The second message was sent from Black Widow to Iron Man, dated April 22, 2016
3. The third message was sent from Hawkeye to Captain America, dated May 3, 2016
4. The fourth message was sent from Captain America to Iron Man, dated on Sep 20, 2017

### **<u>Deliverable 6:</u>** 
Construct a KP-ABE crypto-system and assign a secret key to Iron Man.
### **<u>Deliverable 7:</u>**
Compose the plain text of the four “proof-of-the-concept” (random) messages and then encrypt them with their metadata.
### **<u>Deliverable 8:</u>**
Which messages can be decrypted by Iron Man? Why?
